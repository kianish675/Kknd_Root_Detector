# Android Root Detector

Android Root Detector is a lightweight Android application that checks whether a device may be rooted or running in a potentially insecure environment.

The project demonstrates common techniques used by security‑sensitive Android apps to detect root access and system modifications.

This project is intended mainly for: 
- Android security learning 
- Developers implementing root detection 
- Reverse engineering practice 
- Educational demonstrations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

The application performs several checks typically used in root detection systems:

-   Detection of **`su` binary** in common system paths
-   Detection of **known root management apps**
-   Basic **system integrity checks**
-   Detection of **suspicious files and directories**
-   Native‑based detection methods inspired by security research

These checks help determine whether the device environment might be
compromised.
